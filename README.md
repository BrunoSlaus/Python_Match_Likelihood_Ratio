# Python_Match_Likelihood_Ratio
Match catalogues via the likelihood-ratio method.

This folder contains the codes used to perform a 
LIKELIHOOD RATIO (LR) match. The main idea of the LR
method is to calculate the likelihood of each counterpart
using BOTH its magnitude and its separation distance. 
See a paper by Ciliegi et al. A&A 398, 901-918, 2003, called 
A deep VLA survey at 6 cm in the Lockman Hole, for details.

The codes also take into account the blocking effect
where the weak sources are blocked by the stronger ones.

Contents:
1) Main.py   : Main code. This code calls
               all the other ones.

2) *.py      : A number of other python codes
               needed for the main one to work.

You need the "Input", "Output" and "log" folders
for the codes to work.
